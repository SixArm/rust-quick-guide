# What are good projects to learn Rust?

Learning Rust can be a rewarding experience, and contributing to open-source projects can be a great way to develop your skills while making meaningful contributions to the community.

* Rustlings is a collection of small exercises designed to help you learn Rust syntax and concepts. It covers topics like ownership, borrowing, and macros, and is a great way to start.

* Rust Game Development Working Group is a community of programmers working on game libraries and tools. This group can be a great way to learn about Rust's capabilties for gaming and graphics programming.

* Servo is a modern, high-performance browser engine written in Rust. It is a complex project that touches on many different aspects of systems programming, including concurrency, memory management, and performance optimization.

* Tokio is a runtime for writing asynchronous Rust applications. It provides abstractions and tools for writing scalable and efficient network applications. Contributing to it can be a good way to learn about concurrency,  async/await features, and futures.

* RustCrypto provides cryptographic libraries. It includes implementations of cryptographic algorithms, as well as higher-level libraries for building secure systems. This project can be a great way to learn about Rust memory safety, security, and low-level systems programming.

* The Rust language itself is a great way to learn Rust. Dive into the source code. Learning it and contributing to it can be a great way to learn about the language and its internals.

These are just a few examples of the many open-source Rust projects available for learning and contributing. Whatever your interests, there is likely a Rust project out there that can help you develop your skills.
